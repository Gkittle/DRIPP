Issue with ptreeopt/opt.py line 258
need to create a file to save results in?

Lake class in Lake.py has variables that depend init values in specific instances of the lake class i.e. Gibraltar
There are also many repeated values in each of the lakes, shouldn't those be included in the overall class then

In simulation.py add the lakes/ water sources as an array of objects instead of hard coding them.

This library doesn't include modeling the plant in detail.
